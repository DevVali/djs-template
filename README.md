## Starting the bot

> Tip: Don't forget to edit the `config.json` file with your bot's configuration. 

Before getting into the process of starting your discord.js bot, you will have to register your commands to Discord.

```
node deploy-commands.js
```

Refresh your Discord client and if you see your bot's commands, you're good to go!

Let's start your bot.

```
node index.js
```

If you see "Ready!" after a few seconds, congratulations on starting your discord.js bot. ðŸŽ‰ 

### Initializing database (sequelize)

```
node dbInit.sequelize.js
```
